I will leave this review here because a lot of people don't know what Horizon is.

ED:Horizons is not only a expansion, is a 1 year season full of updates and content. Starting with Landing and having Multicrew, Crafting, more ships/SRV, Carriers and much more planned.

Basically you are buying a 1 year subscription to the game. 

About Horizon:

It add another layer to the game. Landing on planets is fantastic and the SRV is fun to drive. Optimization with all in ultra and with an AMD 7950 I run it between 28-45FPS on planets (sometimes it runs at 60FP in the night side of the planet) it needs optimization. 

Horizon bring to us new and more varied missions and QoL changes to the UI, and not only for Horizon but for the base game owners too and new ships are always welcome (they added 6 ships more if I remember correctly) 

Conclusion: If you are willing to pay for the existing content (landing in planets), for a year of updates and expansion and you like E:D buy it. If not, just wait for a drop in the price or buy it on sale.
